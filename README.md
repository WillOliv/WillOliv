## Hi, i'm Will

I'm a Systems Analysis and Development student at the Federal Institute of Pernambuco, Campus Paulista (IFPE - Paulista). 
I currently took a break from the course to focus on learning front-end development and its sub areas to get my first job and start in my career areas like Digital Design, UX, UI etc.

I'm aiming to learn HTML5 and CSS3 first untill its fully rooted in my mind and after that i intend to search knowledge and techiniques about how give a better experience and interface on my environments.

I am : 
- Currently learning on my own
- Trying to build a base portifolio
- Get my first job to have real experiences
- Interested in design and its variations
- Trying to develop more creativity and externalize it.
